// You are given two identical eggs and you have access to a building with n
// floors labeled from 1 to n.

// You know that there exists a floor f where 0 <= f <= n such that any egg
// dropped at a floor higher than f will break, and any egg dropped at or below
// floor f will not break.

// In each move, you may take an unbroken egg and drop it from any floor x
// (where 1 <= x <= n). If the egg breaks, you can no longer use it. However, if
// the egg does not break, you may reuse it in future moves.

// Return the minimum number of moves that you need to determine with certainty
// what the value of f is.

// Example 1:

// Input: n = 2
// Output: 2
// Explanation: We can drop the first egg from floor 1 and the second egg from
// floor 2. If the first egg breaks, we know that f = 0. If the second egg
// breaks but the first egg didn't, we know that f = 1. Otherwise, if both eggs
// survive, we know that f = 2. Example 2:

// Input: n = 100
// Output: 14
// Explanation: One optimal strategy is:
// - Drop the 1st egg at floor 9. If it breaks, we know f is between 0 and 8.
// Drop the 2nd egg starting from floor 1 and going up one at a time to find f
// within 8 more drops. Total drops is 1 + 8 = 9.
// - If the 1st egg does not break, drop the 1st egg again at floor 22. If it
// breaks, we know f is between 9 and 21. Drop the 2nd egg starting from floor
// 10 and going up one at a time to find f within 12 more drops. Total drops is
// 2 + 12 = 14.
// - If the 1st egg does not break again, follow a similar process dropping the
// 1st egg from floors 34, 45, 55, 64, 72, 79, 85, 90, 94, 97, 99, and 100.
// Regardless of the outcome, it takes at most 14 drops to determine f.

// Constraints:

// 1 <= n <= 1000
